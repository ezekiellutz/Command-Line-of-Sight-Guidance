# Command-Line-of-Sight (CLOS) Guidance
A model that simulates the applications for Command-Line-of-Sight (CLOS) guidance and how it operates in real-world environments.

# Installation Instructions
Download the .py file and place to your directory of choice on the host PC. It is recommended that the file be run in its own folder, as the model will output both an .xlsx file in addition to a .jpg file. Run the file from your IDE of choice. The model can be easily modified to get a better understanding of how proportional navigation works. Simply modify the starting variables to see the effect they have on the model. 

It is recommended that this model be run in Spyder 5.1.5 [conda (Python 3.9.7)].
